# Masters-of-Networks-5
Ethnographic data hackathon to design the opencare dashboard

MoN5 took place in Milano on October 28th 2016. A group of ethnographers and networks scientists gathered to make collective sense of the opencare dataset.
We worked in groups, each group exploring an approach to apply network and data science to the ethnographic data.
