From the tag-tag network, we filtered out edges to keep only edges with the
maximal edge force. Then we have selected the corresponding node tags. Inside the
forum network, we have computed the reachable sugraph from the previous
selected tags. From the reachable subgraph, we remove nodes and edges related
to only one tag. We kept only elements which are part of a path between at
least two selected tags.
